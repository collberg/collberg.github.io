   This transformation turns a function into an interpreter, whose
   bytecode language is specialized for this function. The
   transformation has been designed to induce as much diversity as
   possible, i.e. every decision made is dependent on the
   randomization seed. The diversity is both static and dynamic, i.e. each
   interpreter variant differs in the structure of its code as well as
   in its execution pattern.
